OLD SCHOOL HACK BESTIARY

This is a ridiculously simple Django app that just allows users to create creatures and powers, and display them on the site. It might get more sophisticated down the road, but for now, heck, it'll do.

You need to install 'tagging' and 'django-autoslug' for this baby, and the admin site needs to be turned on. That's pretty much it.
